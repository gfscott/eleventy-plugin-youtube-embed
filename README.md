# âœ‹ Plugin code has [moved](https://github.com/gfscott/eleventy-plugin-embed-everything). ðŸ¤š

But donâ€™t be alarmed! It still exists.

- The codebase has been migrated into the [Embed Everything monorepo](https://github.com/gfscott/eleventy-plugin-embed-everything).
- Itâ€™s still actively maintained.
- The original plugin code is still available to view in the [`main` branch](https://github.com/gfscott/eleventy-plugin-youtube-embed/tree/main)
- You can still [install this package with npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-youtube-embed), same as before.
